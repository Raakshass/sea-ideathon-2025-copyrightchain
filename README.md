🏆 CopyrightChain – SEA Ideathon 2025
Protecting Digital Art with AI + Blockchain
🎨 The Problem
Digital artists are constantly facing art theft — about 85% of them! People steal and repost art without permission, which leads to lost income and no way to prove who created it first.

For example, Sarah, a digital artist from Vietnam, struggles to:

Prove she created her art first

Stop others from copying and using her art

Show her art is original

Make fair money from her work

✅ Our Solution: CopyrightChain
We built a platform that:

Verifies art originality using AI

Registers copyright on blockchain forever

Lets artists earn with a licensing system

Uses a dual-token model for payments (VNST & vBTC)

This is a full SEA (Science + Economics + Art) integration:

🔬 SCIENCE (AI Verification)
We use AI to check if the art is original

It gives a score (from 65% to 100%) showing how likely it's authentic

We store everything on IPFS, a decentralized storage system

💰 ECONOMICS (Artist-Friendly Economy)
Artists can earn through licensing their art

Payments happen using VNST (Vietnam Stable Token) and vBTC (Virtual Bitcoin)

Smart contracts automate fair fees and secure transactions

🖼️ ART (Copyright Protection)
Artwork is time-stamped on the blockchain

Stored forever in decentralized storage

Cannot be changed or faked

Accepted globally as proof of ownership

🚀 Try It Out – Demo Steps
Upload your artwork

Connect your MetaMask wallet

Get test tokens (VNST & vBTC)

Register your artwork with title and image hash
