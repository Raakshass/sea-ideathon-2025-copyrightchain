# 🏆 CopyrightChain – SEA Ideathon 2025

### Protecting Digital Art with AI + Blockchain


## 🎨 The Problem

Digital artists are constantly facing **art theft** — about **85%** of them! People steal and repost art without permission, which leads to lost income and no way to prove who created it first.

**Meet Sarah**, a digital artist from Vietnam, who struggles to:

* Prove she created her art first
* Stop others from copying and using her art
* Show her art is original
* Make fair money from her work


## ✅ Our Solution: CopyrightChain

We built a platform that:

* ✅ **Verifies art originality using AI**
* 🔒 **Registers copyright on blockchain forever**
* 💸 **Lets artists earn with a licensing system**
* 💱 **Uses a dual-token model for payments (VNST & vBTC)**

This is a full **SEA (Science + Economics + Art)** integration.

---

## 🔬 SCIENCE (AI Verification)

* We use AI to check if the art is original
* It gives a score (from **65% to 100%**) showing how likely it's authentic
* We store everything on **IPFS**, a decentralized storage system

---

## 💰 ECONOMICS (Artist-Friendly Economy)

* Artists can earn through licensing their art
* Payments happen using **VNST** (Vietnam Stable Token) and **vBTC** (Virtual Bitcoin)
* Smart contracts automate fair fees and secure transactions

---

## 🖼️ ART (Copyright Protection)

* Artwork is time-stamped on the blockchain
* Stored forever in decentralized storage
* Cannot be changed or faked
* Accepted globally as proof of ownership
